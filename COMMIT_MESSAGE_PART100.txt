feat: implement deck pack system (O027-O034)

Implements complete deck pack infrastructure for quick board customization:

NEW FEATURES:
- Deck pack registry with search/filter by category, difficulty, tags
- Three builtin starter packs:
  * Essential Production (mixer, transport, browser, properties)
  * Notation Essentials (score, properties, instruments, DSP)
  * Sound Design Lab (routing, spectrum, waveform, modulation)
- Beautiful deck pack browser UI with:
  * Search and multi-dimensional filtering
  * Preview modals showing pack contents
  * One-click installation to current board
- Intelligent conflict resolution:
  * Auto-rename decks with ID collisions
  * Detailed error reporting for manual resolution
  * Installation tracking per board

NEW FILES:
- src/boards/deck-packs/types.ts (pack definitions)
- src/boards/deck-packs/registry.ts (search & discovery)
- src/boards/deck-packs/add-pack.ts (installation logic)
- src/boards/deck-packs/builtins.ts (3 starter packs)
- src/boards/deck-packs/register.ts (registration helper)
- src/boards/deck-packs/index.ts (barrel exports)
- src/ui/components/deck-pack-browser.ts (browser UI)
- src/boards/deck-packs/deck-packs.test.ts (19 tests)

TECHNICAL:
- Zero type errors maintained
- 19/19 tests passing (registry, builtins, addition, conflicts)
- ~1,585 lines production code
- Full TypeScript type safety with exactOptionalPropertyTypes
- Beautiful browser UI with accessibility
- Production-ready code quality

TESTING:
✅ Deck pack registration and retrieval
✅ Search by category, difficulty, tags, text
✅ All builtin packs valid and unique
✅ Pack addition without conflicts
✅ Auto-rename conflict resolution
✅ Manual conflict handling (errors)
✅ Installation tracking per board
✅ Graceful error handling for missing packs/boards
