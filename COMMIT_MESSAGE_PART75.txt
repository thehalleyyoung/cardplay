feat(boards): Add board settings panel and complete session actions

PART 75: Systematic roadmap implementation with settings UI and action fixes

Core Changes:
- Board settings panel with display preferences (visual density, tracker base, animation)
- Fixed session grid actions with proper ClipRegistry.deleteClip() integration
- Verified documentation completeness (K004, K005 already exist)
- Confirmed F057 hex/decimal toggle already implemented in DisplayConfig

New Components:
- src/boards/settings/board-settings-panel.ts (15KB, full settings UI)
- src/boards/settings/board-settings-panel.test.ts (9 test cases, all passing)

Bug Fixes:
- Session clip deletion now properly removes from registry

Roadmap Updates:
- F057: Hex/decimal toggle (verified complete via DisplayConfig.base)
- K004: Project compatibility doc (verified exists)
- K005: Board switching semantics doc (verified exists)

- J052-J053: Visual density settings (now complete)

Features:
- Display density: compact/comfortable/spacious with per-board persistence
- Tracker number base selector (hex/decimal) for tracker boards
- Deck header and control indicator visibility toggles
- Animation speed control (disabled/normal/fast)
- Settings persistence via BoardStateStore in deckSettings.display
- Event emission for UI reactivity

Test Coverage:
- 9 new tests for board settings panel
- Panel creation, rendering, sections, events, read-only mode
