feat(tests): Add comprehensive integration tests for cross-view sync and routing

- Add cross-view-sync.test.ts with 5 tests validating shared event store
  - A055: Tracker edits reflected in piano roll
  - A056: Piano roll edits reflected in notation  
  - A057: Selection synchronization across all views using EventIds
  - Tests for concurrent edits and event identity preservation
  
- Add routing-persistence.test.ts with 5 tests for routing graph
  - A084: Connection creation and persistence
  - A085: Connection deletion and cleanup
  - Tests for multi-source connections and cycle detection

- Fix type errors in persona enhancements
  - tracker-user-enhancements.ts: Use correct EventStreamId API (.id property)
  - producer-enhancements.ts: Remove unused EventId import

- Update currentsteps-branchA.md marking integration tests complete

Test suite: 7797 passing tests across 169 test files (new record)
New tests: 10/10 passing (100% pass rate)
Type errors: 35 (all pre-existing in AI/theory files)

This validates the core architecture:
- SharedEventStore as single source of truth
- Event identity preserved across views
- Selection by EventId (not indices)
- Routing graph state management
- Cross-view data consistency
