feat(gofai): Implement Step 308 - Plan opcode executors for core event transforms (800+ LoC)

STEP COMPLETED:
- [x] Step 308: Plan opcode executors for core event transforms

IMPLEMENTATION:

1. Core Execution Infrastructure (src/gofai/execution/plan-executor.ts)
   - ExecutionContext: Runtime context for opcode execution
   - ExecutionOptions: Configurable execution behavior
   - OpcodeExecutionResult: Standardized result type with provenance
   - ExecutionError: Structured error reporting with suggestions
   - ProvenanceRecord: Complete change → opcode → goal traceability

2. Eight Core Opcode Executors:
   - executeQuantize: Grid quantization with strength control
   - executeShiftTiming: Time offset transformations
   - executeShiftPitch: Pitch transposition
   - executeScaleVelocity: Dynamic range adjustments
   - executeThinDensity: Texture reduction via event removal
   - executeDensify: Texture expansion via event addition
   - executeShiftRegister: Octave-based register shifts
   - executeHumanizeTiming: Natural timing variation

3. Execution Framework:
   - OPCODE_EXECUTORS: Extensible registry pattern
   - executeOpcode: Type-safe dispatcher with unknown opcode handling
   - executePlan: Sequential plan execution with accumulation
   - applyPlanToFork: Pure functional state transformation
   - computeDiff: Before/after state comparison with summaries

4. Design Principles:
   - Pure functions (no input mutation)
   - Type-safe parameter handling
   - Composable executors via registry
   - Deterministic execution
   - Full provenance tracking
   - Structured error handling with recovery suggestions

METRICS:
- 800+ lines of implementation code
- 8 opcode executors
- 6 core infrastructure types
- 3 execution patterns (execute, apply, compute diff)

NOTES:
- Establishes extensibility pattern for future opcodes
- Enables structure, harmony, melody, and production edits
- Foundation for extension-provided opcode integration
- API integration with actual types needs refinement (params Map, selector conversion)

NEXT STEPS:
- Step 309: Structure edit executors (sections, breaks)
- Step 310: Card parameter edit executors
- Steps 311-313: Parameter schema validation and coercion
- Steps 314-350: Capabilities, undo, constraints, tests

Implements systematic changes from gofai_goalB.md Phase 6.
Follows GOFAI Music+ architectural principles: typed IRs, composable transforms, full provenance.
