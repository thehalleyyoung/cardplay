## Overview

This roadmap integrates the **Board-Centric UI Architecture** from `cardplay/cardplayui.md` with the vision of a configurable board system for any type of user—from notation composers to graphic composers to tracker users to sound designers—with "as much or as little AI as you want."

The AI system will be **Prolog-based** (rule-based reasoning, not neural networks) using declarative logic over deck layouts, music theory, and compositional patterns. Reference implementation: https://github.com/kkty/prolog

### Roadmap Structure

The roadmap is organized into **logical phases** that build upon each other:

1. **Phase A: Baseline & Repo Health** (A001–A100) - Fix type errors, stabilize APIs, establish baseline
2. **Phase B: Board System Core** (B001–B150) - Core board types, registry, persistence, validation
3. **Phase C: Board Switching UI & Persistence** (C001–C100) - Board switcher, browser, first-run flow
4. **Phase D: Card Availability & Tool Gating** (D001–D080) - Runtime gating logic, tool visibility
5. **Phase E: Deck/Stack/Panel Unification** (E001–E090) - Deck instances, factories, drag/drop
6. **Phase F: Manual Boards** (F001–F120) - Pure manual boards (notation, tracker, sampler, session)
7. **Phase G: Assisted Boards** (G001–G120) - Manual + hints/phrases (tracker+harmony, etc.)
8. **Phase H: Generative Boards** (H001–H075) - AI-driven boards (arranger, composer, ambient)
9. **Phase I: Hybrid Boards** (I001–I075) - Power user boards (composer, producer, live performance)
10. **Phase J: Routing, Theming, Shortcuts** (J001–J060) - Visual polish, routing overlay, shortcuts
11. **Phase K: QA, Performance, Docs, Release** (K001–K030) - Final QA, benchmarks, release prep
12. **Phase L: Prolog AI Foundation** (L001–L400) - Prolog engine, knowledge bases, query system
13. **Phase M: Persona-Specific Enhancements** (M001–M400) - Deep persona workflows
14. **Phase N: Advanced AI Features** (N001–N400) - Learning, adaptation, advanced inference
15. **Phase O: Community & Ecosystem** (O001–O400) - Templates, marketplace, collaboration
16. **Phase P: Polish & Launch** (P001–P200) - Final polish, documentation, launch prep

**Total Steps: ~2,800** (expandable as needed)

   - Added input context detection (pauses shortcuts in text fields except undo/redo)
   - Created UI event bus to avoid cross-import tangles
   - Integrated board switcher with event bus for clean modal coordination

2. **UI Event Bus System (C055)** ✅
   - Created centralized event bus for UI coordination
   - Supports board-switcher, board-browser, help-panel, and first-run events
   - Clean pub/sub pattern with unsubscribe support
   - Prevents circular dependencies between UI components

3. **Board System Initialization (B146-B150, C051)** ✅
   - Enhanced initializeBoardSystem() to wire all components together
   - Auto-selects default board if none persisted
   - Initializes board switcher UI event listeners
   - Starts keyboard shortcut manager

   - Fixed potential undefined access in piano-roll-factory.ts
   - All type errors resolved (0 errors)

5. **Build & Test Status**

### Technical Implementation

The keyboard shortcut and event bus integration creates a clean architecture:

```typescript
// At app startup:
const cleanup = initializeBoardSystem();

// This automatically:
// 1. Registers all builtin boards
// 2. Registers all deck factories  
// 3. Wires Cmd+B → board switcher via event bus
// 4. Starts keyboard shortcut manager
// 5. Sets default board if needed

// User presses Cmd+B anywhere:
// → Keyboard shortcut manager emits 'board-switcher:open'
// → Event bus routes to board switcher component
// → Modal opens with recent/favorite boards
// → User can search, navigate with arrow keys, Enter to switch
```
