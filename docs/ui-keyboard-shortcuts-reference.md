# UI Keyboard Shortcuts (Reference)
Assumes canonical model and terminology in `cardplay2.md` (repo root).

This app is intentionally keyboard-friendly, but not all flows are fully bound yet.

## Global

- `Space`: Play/Stop (session playback)
- `R`: Record toggle (uses current recording target; auto-selects a target when possible)
- `Ctrl/Cmd` + `K`: Focus Command Palette input
- `Ctrl/Cmd` + `/`: Focus the panel filter input
- `Ctrl/Cmd` + `Shift` + `L`: Open Layout dialog
- `Escape`: Exit focused panel mode (after double-clicking a panel title)

## Panel Navigation

- `1`: Getting Started
- `2`: Session
- `3`: Tracker
- `4`: Pads
- `5`: Audio
- `6`: Stack Builder

## Notes

- Many text inputs intentionally “capture” typing and disable global shortcuts while focused.

## Tracker/Piano Roll

- `Arrow keys`: Navigate notes
- `Enter`: Toggle/edit note
- `Delete`/`Backspace`: Delete selected notes

- `+`/`-`: Transpose up/down (future)

## Render & Export

- `Ctrl/Cmd` + `E`: Open render dialog

## Stack Builder

- `Ctrl/Cmd` + `N`: Add new card (future)
- `Delete`: Remove selected card
